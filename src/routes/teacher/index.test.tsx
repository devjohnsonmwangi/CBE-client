// This file used to contain in-repo tests which interfered with Vite in dev mode
// (Vite would import test files under `src/` which can cause Vitest to fail at runtime).
// The test was moved to the top-level `test/` directory. Keep a lightweight
// route registration here for the teacher route.
// This file previously registered a Route and/or contained in-repo tests.
// Tests should live under the top-level `test/` directory; route
// registration for `/teacher` lives in `index.tsx`.
